## Skateboarding Styles

- Slalom: skateboarding down a hill/slope, weaving between different obstacles.
- Downhill: skateboarding on a longboard downhill.
- Freestyle: technical flat ground skateboarding. Often a freestyle skateboarder will need more than a board and flat ground. Music and choreography is an essential part of the routine.
- Street: focuses on tricks and different transistions in public areas. Street skaters skate in urban streets, plazas and/or industrial areas.
- Vert: is riding a skateboard on a skate ramp or other inclines and involves the skater moving from the horizontal plane to the vertical plane in order to perform tricks.
- Pool: when a swimming pool is drained and you skate the walls and edges of the pool.
- Park: is all about skatboarding half-pipes, quarter pipes, spine transfers, handrails, funboxes, vert ramps, bowls, stairs, and a number of other objects.
- Cruising: is done with longboards. Takes you from A to B by just skateboarding without worrying about doing tricks.
- Off-Road: is also known as mountain-boarding. The board is made up of the deck, bindings and four pneumatic tires. Mountain boarding is designed for riding grass hills, BMX courses, woodlands, and mountain bike trails. You are able to ride a variety of terrain.
