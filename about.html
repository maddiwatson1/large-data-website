    	<h1>Controversy</h1>
			<p>Skateboarding is sometimes associated with property damage to urban terrain features such as curbs, benches, and ledges when skateboarders perform tricks known as grinds on these surfaces. Private industry has responded to this perceived damage with skate deterrent devices, such as the Skatestopper, in an effort to mitigate damage and discourage skateboarding on these surfaces. The passing of ordinances and the use of posted signs stating <em>Skateboarding is notallowed</em> has also become a common methodology, to mitigate skateboarding in public areas in many cities, to protect pedestrians and property.In the area of street skating, tickets and arrest from police for trespassing are not uncommon.</p>

    <h1>Skate Styles</h1>
			<h3>Slalom:</h3>
				<p>skateboarding down a hill/slope, weaving between different obstacles.</p>
			<h3>Downhill:</h3>
				<p>skateboarding on a longboard downhill.</p>
			<h3>Freestyle:</h3>
				<p>technical flat ground skateboarding. Often a freestyle skateboarder will need more than a board and flat ground. Music and choreography is an essential part of the routine.</p>
			<h3>Street:</h3>
				<p>focuses on tricks and different transistions in public areas. Street skaters skate in urban streets, plazas and/or industrial areas.</p>
			<h3>Vert:</h3>
				<p>is riding a skateboard on a skate ramp or other inclines and involves the skater moving from the horizontal plane to the vertical plane in order to perform tricks.</p>
			<h3>Pool:</h3>
				<p>when a swimming pool is drained and you skate the walls and edges of the pool.</p>
			<h3>Park:</h3>
				<p>is all about skatboarding half-pipes, quarter pipes, spine transfers, handrails, funboxes, vert ramps, bowls, stairs, and a number of other objects.</p>
			<h3>Cruising:</h3>
				<p>is done with longboards. Takes you from A to B by just skateboarding without worrying about doing tricks.</p>
			<h3>Off-Road:</h3>
				<p>is also known as mountain-boarding. The board is made up of the deck, bindings and four pneumatic tires. Mountain boarding is designed for riding grass hills, BMX courses, woodlands, and mountain bike trails. You are able to ride a variety of terrain.</p>

    	<h1>Anatomy of a Skateboard</h1>
    	<h3>Hardware:</h3>
        	<p>Nuts, bolts, and screws that hold the trucks, bushings, and base plate onto the board.</p>
        <h3>Board:</h3>
        	<p>Also known as the Deck, this is the main part of a skateboard, the portion that is used to skate on. Boards are typically made of 7 or 9 plies of maple, birch, or some other wood, laminated together and shaped into numerous board shapes.</p>
        <h3>Grip Tape:</h3>
        	<p>sandpaper affixed to the top of the board with adhesive. Grip tape provides traction so movement from the feet is transferred to the board.</p>
        <h3>Nose:</h3>
        	<p>the front of the skateboard.</p>
        <h3>Tail:</h3>
        	<p> the rear of the skateboard, usually measured from the rear truck bolts to the end of the board.</p>
        <h3>Trucks:</h3>
        	<p>The truck is the collective name for the front and rear axle assemblies that connect the wheels to the deck and provide the turning capabilities for the board.</p>
        <h3>Axle:</h3>
        	<p>The axle is a metal rod which runs through the hanger and extends from it on either side.</p>
        <h3>Wheels:</h3>
        	<p>usually made of polyurethane and sized between 39 and 70 millimeters in diameter; their hardness is measured by durometer, a number ranging from 0 to 100â€”soft wheels have a durometer of about 85, hard wheels have a durometer of 98 or higher .63 mm wheels are usually more for longboards which go significantly faster.</p>
        <h3>Wheelbase:</h3>
        	<p> the distance between the front and back wheels, measured between the two sets of innermost truck holes.</p>
        <h3>Kingpin:</h3>
        	<p>Is a partially threaded pin placed through the base plate and truck and secured with the kingpin nut.</p>
        <h3>Bushing:</h3>
        	<p>Bushings are donut-shaped polyurethane pieces that are inserted onto the kingpin of a truck. There are two bushings per truck, one above and one below where the hanger fits onto the kingpin.</p>
        <h3>Pivot Cup:</h3>
        	<p>A raised and hollowed receptacle on the base plate opposite the kingpin which holds the pivot bushing.</p>
        <h3>Pivot Bushing:</h3>
        	<p> A plastic cup-shaped piece which rests in the pivot cup of the base plate and supports the truck's hanger at the pivot point allowing the truck to pivot smoothly.</p>
        <h3>Bearings:</h3>
        	<p> In skateboarding bearings allow for the smooth turning of a wheel on its axle. Bearings consist of 6, 7, or 8 balls enclosed in races between two shields encased in a disc-like body.</p>
        <h3>Crown:</h3>
        	<p>Crowns are also called retainers or cages and are usually made of Delrin. Crowns hold and separate the individual balls in a bearing.</p>
        <h3>Bearing Shield:</h3>
        	<p> Are the two walls that hold the ball bearings and Delrin crowns from falling out. The bearing shield plays an important role as well in keeping dirt from getting into the bearing and slowing it down.</p>
        <h3>C Clip:</h3>
        	<p> The C clip is a mechanism for locking bearing shields in place. It is essentially a thin C-shaped wire that fits tightly into a groove around the outside perimeter of the bearing shield to hold it in place against the bearing casing.</p>
        <h3>Casing:</h3>
        	<p>The casing is the body of the bearing. It holds the ball bearings, crown, and shield in place.</p>
