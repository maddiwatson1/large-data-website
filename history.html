		<h1>History</h1>
			<h2>1940s to 1960s</h2>
    			<p>Skateboarding was came to be in the late 1940s/early 1950s when surfers in California wanted something to surf when the waves were flat. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. These first skateboarders started with wooden boxes or boards with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom.</p>

				<p>The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, to be used by surfers during downtime. Skateboarding was originally known  as "sidewalk surfing" and early skaters copied the surfing style and maneuvers.</p>

				<p>By the 1960s a small amount of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as Jack's, Kips', Hobie, Bing's and Makaha started making skateboards that resembled smaller surfboards, and put together their own teams to promote their skateboards.</p>

				<p>The growth of the sport during this period can also be seen in sales figures for Makaha, which quoted $10 million worth of board sales between 1963 and 1965 (Weyland, 2002:28). By 1966 a variety of sources began to claim that skateboarding was dangerous, resulting in shops being reluctant to sell them, and parents being reluctant to buy them. In 1966 sales had dropped significantly (ibid) and Skateboarder Magazine had stopped publication. The popularity of skateboarding dropped and remained low until the early 1970s.</p>

			<h2>1970s</h2>
    			<p>In the early 1970s skateparks hadn't been invented yet, so skateboarders would flock and skateboard in such urban places like The Escondido reservoir in San Diego, California. Skateboarding magazine would publish the location and skateboarders made up nicknames for each location such as the Tea Bowl, the Fruit Bowl, Bellagio, the Rabbit Hole, Bird Bath, the Egg Bowl, Upland Pool and the Sewer Slide. Some of the development concepts in the terrain of skateparks were actually taken from the Escondido reservoir. Many companies started to manufacture trucks (axles) specially designed for skateboarding, reached in 1976 by Tracker Trucks. As the equipment became more maneuverable, the decks started to get wider, reaching widths of 10 inches (250 mm) and over, thus giving the skateboarder even more control. A banana board is a skinny, flexible skateboard made of polypropylene with ribs on the underside for structural support. These were very popular during the mid-1970s and were available in myriad colors, bright yellow probably being the most memorable, hence the name.</p>

				<p>In 1975 skateboarding had come back in popularity enough to have one of the largest skateboarding competition's since the 1960s, the Del Mar National Championships, which is said to have had up to 500 competitors.a local skate team from Santa Monica, California, the *Zephyr* team, ushered in a new era of surfer style skateboarding during the competition that would have a lasting impact on skateboarding's history. With a team of 12, including skating legends such as Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Peggy Oki & Stacy Peralta, they brought a new progressive style of skateboarding to the event, based on the style of Hawaiian surfers Larry Bertlemann, Buttons Kaluhiokalani and Mark Liddell.</p>
        
       		 	<p>Manufacturers started to experiment with more exotic composites and metals, like fiberglass and aluminium, but the common skateboards were made of maple plywood. The skateboarders took advantage of the improved handling of their skateboards and started inventing new tricks. Skateboarders, most notably Ty Page, Bruce Logan, Bobby Piercy, Kevin Reed, and the Z-Boys started to skate the vertical walls of swimming pools that were left empty in the 1976 California drought. This started the "vert" trend in skateboarding. With increased control, vert skaters could skate faster and perform more dangerous tricks, such as slash grinds and frontside/backside airs.</p>
        
        		<p>As a result of the "vert" skating movement, skate parks had to contend with high-liability costs that led to many park closures. In response, vert skaters started making their own ramps, while freestyle skaters continued to evolve their flatland style. Thus by the beginning of the 1980s, skateboarding had once again declined in popularity.</p>
        
			<h2>1980s</h2>
    			<p>This period was fueled by skateboard companies that were run by skateboarders. The focus was initially on vert ramp skateboarding. As most people could not afford to build vert ramps, or did not have access to nearby ramps, street skating increased in popularity.</p>

				<p>Freestyle skating remained healthy throughout this period, with pioneers such as Rodney Mullen inventing many of the basic tricks that would become the foundation of modern street skating, such as the "Impossible" and the "kickflip". By 1992, only a small fraction of skateboarders remained as a highly technical version of street skating, combined with the decline of vert skating, produced a sport that lacked the mainstream appeal to attract new skaters.</p>
        
			<h2>1990s to Present</h2>
    			<p>During the 90s, skateboarding was dominated by street skateboarding. The boards were about 7 1/4 to 8 inches wide and 30-32 inches long. The wheels were now being made of an extremely hard polyurethane with hardness (durometer) approximately 99A. The wheels were small which meant the boards were light; this allowed tricks to be more manageable.</p>

				<p>Come 2001 skateboarding had gained in popularity and more participants under the age of 18 rode skateboards than they played baseball.</p>

				<p>In 2003 <strong>Go Skateboarding Day</strong> was founded in southern California by the <em>International Association of Skateboard Companies</em> to help promote skateboarding all around the world. This day is celebrated every year on June 21st. The market research firm <em>American Sports Data</em> the number of skateboarders in the world has increased by more than 60% between the years 1999-2002 â€” from 7.8 million to 12.5 million.</p>

				<p>By 2006 there were over 2,400 Skateparks world wide and the design of skateparks themselves had made a transition, as skaters turned designers, began to emerge in the field adding features for all levels of skaters. Many new places to skateboard designed specifically for street skaters, such as the <strong>Safe Spot Skate Spot</strong> program, first initiated by professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek throughout many cites, allowed for the creation of smaller alternative safe skate plazas to be built at a lower cost. One of the largest locations ever built to skateboard in the world, <em>SMP Skatepark</em> in China, at 12,000 square meters in size, was built complete with a 5,000-seat stadium.</p>
