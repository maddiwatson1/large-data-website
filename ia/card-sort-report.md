## Observations

- No comments were really made by the card sorters. Although Nigel had mentioned how he doesn't know anything about skateboarding.
- No questions were asked at all.
- Cassie didn't struggle with any topics, and Nigel was unsure of how to categorize or where to put the 'Skateboarders' card.
- They both used the 'What is Skateboarding?' card as a header. Cassie had sorted everything into 4 categories where as Nigel used three; thus resulting in completely different groupings.
- I would say that the groupings were kind of what I was expecting to a certain extent.
- Cassie's results were similar to what I was looking at doing.
- Both Cassie and Nigel seemed to of enjoyed performing the card sort, so that being said I felt good.
