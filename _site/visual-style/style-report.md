# Style Report

While creating the style tiles for this website I kept in mind that there will be users of all ages viewing this. I went with different colours that I knew would attract those interested in skateboarding. I had decided to keep the logo I created the same throughout every style as it is suitable for all ages.

With that in mind, I wanted the look of the overall website to be clean and simple but still have that grungy feel. I didn't differentiate the style tiles too much because of the kind of users that this will be appealing to. To do this I have decided to implement grunge style textures; along with that I have also shown different effects that could be used on the buttons and/or images.

## Style Tile 1

For my first style tile, I had chosen colours that are more muted and clean. The con about this style I feel is that it would attract more older users than younger because the colours don't stand out as much. It is a style that is more grown up and would be for someone who is into something that has more of a modern day style to it.

## Style Tile 2

For this style tile, I had gone with colours that would appeal to users of all ages. I feel that with the skateboarding lifestyle, red, white, black and grey are very common. I went with these colours because I knew that they will always be liked by skateboarders. I had decided to implement an effect on the colour bar where the logo is and an effect on the first pattern. The con about the first pattern is that the colour and effect may not be suited for this style.

## Style Tile 3

For this last style tile, I had decided to use brighter colours. I chose brighter colours because I know it would be appealing to the younger users. I didn't use too many effects or textures because those of a younger age won't necessarily care about it. You want to make a website easy to navigate through for those of a younger age; this will help them become less confused. To do this, I decided to go with a font that is bold and easy to read. I feel that the con for this style tile would be that those of an older age won't be appealed to these bright colours and plain easy-to-read fonts.
